                <p>One user interface I use everyday is Facebook. As an avid Facebook user for many years, I have seen many updates that tries to improve functionality of the site and the aesthetic. In a visual design aspect, I feel that the site could still be improved, because at times, I feel that it feels very busy (especially when I don’t have ad-blocker on). It also feels busy with the many icons the site has, such as icons for different groups and icons for features the site offers. However, the site is effective in that it invites user interaction. While there are many social media sites on the internet, Facebook is still one of the top sites. This is due to its appeal. It appeals to users, because users are able to reconnect with old friends, follow their favorite companies, and stay in touch with current events. This “all in one” aspect is very appealing, because it reduces people’s need for having more than one tab and switching between sites.</p>
