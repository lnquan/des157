            <p>A web-based form I used often is <a href="http://www.when2meet.com">where2meet.com.</a> The website's sole purpose is for people to organize a meeting <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects"> "Learning IxD From Everyday Objects" by Bill DeRouchey</a>,
                an interface communicates clearly through words, icons and colors. It uses color to communicate when is the optimal time to meet, by having the best time, be a darker green, while the least optimal time white. It is using the different
                saturation of green. I feel that it is a very ingenious way of visualizing people’s availability, because the saturated green means more pigment, which is a symbol for the people available. It uses words to show people how many people
                and who are available at a time and directs users to know where to sign in and fill the form. Without the words, the website would be extremely confusing and ineffective. Although there aren’t any icons within this website, it is still
                a successful interface, because it is to the point and intuitive to the users.

            <p>A user interface I use everyday is Facebook, because it allows me to connect with my family and friends from all steps of life. The ability to connect with people from around the world and the different amount of content continuously encourages
                users to scroll through their newsfeed. Due to the large amount of active users on the site, everyone’s newsfeed is updated with new content. In an aesthetic aspect, the interface of Facebook is busy, because the page has a lot of text.
                However, with this amount of text, Facebook successfully minimizes the appearance by giving the webpage columns and creating a system for visual hierarchy. This interface also encourages user interaction, because they include buttons such
                as “like,” “comment,” and “share” to encourage users to show how they feel about a certain article or image. Facebook also allows users to follow and like pages from their favorite companies, celebrities, and internet personalities, which
                invites even more engagement from the user.</p>
