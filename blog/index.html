              <p>Spotify uses green as a spot color to reinforces the idea that the application is good and energetic. It uses a black background to make it easy on the eyes and brings the text and album art forward. It continues with its limited color scheme by having the text to be either white, when its active, selected, or important and gray when its not selected.  To organize the content, Spotify uses a four column grid, it uses the far left grid as a menu bar for users to select their playlists, explore music and search their saved music. It uses the other 3 columns for the actual interface, such as showing albums or playlists the user should explore.

                <p>A user interface I use everyday is Facebook, because it allows me to connect with my family and friends from all steps of life. The ability to connect with people from around the world and the different amount of content continuously encourages users to scroll through their newsfeed. Due to the large amount of active users on the site, everyone’s newsfeed is updated with new content. In an aesthetic aspect, the interface of Facebook is busy, because the page has a lot of text. However, with this amount of text, Facebook successfully minimizes the appearance by giving the webpage columns and creating a system for visual hierarchy. This interface also encourages user interaction, because they include buttons such as “like,” “comment,” and “share” to encourage users to show how they feel about a certain article or image. Facebook also allows users to follow and like pages from their favorite companies, celebrities, and internet personalities, which invites even more engagement from the user.</p>
