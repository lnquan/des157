            <p>For my Studio 4 design, I used a limited color schemes, so that my user doesn’t get confused or overwhelmed by too many colors, type, and images. I tried keeping it very minimal to make users move their mouse around to discover my tooltips.
                For example, the home page doesn’t have anything, except for the title and a bottom bar with buttons, so that the user will click on the buttons instantly. I also encourage interactivity in my interface, by making users click through the
                interface to see the whole time, and some tooltips to make the users explore the website thoroughly. I also added headlines and images so that users will instantly know what the current section they are on is about.

            <h3>3 | February 07, 2017</h3>

            <p>For my final design for Studio 3, I connected the various boxes with colors. For instance, the first box that pops up that shows the inside of each pocket uses a black border to connect with the black outlines of the backpack. On the second
                box that appears when you click on an item, it uses a yellow border which resembles the hover of the items. I also use hovers to make it visually interesting for the user. By using hovers, it is showing the user where they will be clicking
                and what is selected so it is clear. To make the text clear, I am using different headers and a p tag for the body text. By using different headers and p tag, I am able to change the size of the text and bold the headers. Having different
                sizes shows user what is important information, where to read first, and establish a visual hierarchy.

            <p>A web-based form I used often is <a href="http://www.when2meet.com">where2meet.com.</a> The website's sole purpose is for people to organize a meeting time for groups of people. It allows people to easily visualize people's availability. <a
                    href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects"> "Learning IxD From Everyday Objects" by Bill DeRouchey</a>, an interface communicates clearly through words, icons and colors. It uses color to communicate when
                is the optimal time to meet, by having the best time, be a darker green, while the least optimal time white. It is using the different saturation of green. I feel that it is a very ingenious way of visualizing people’s availability, because
                the saturated green means more pigment, which is a symbol for the people available. It uses words to show people how many people and who are available at a time and directs users to know where to sign in and fill the form. Without the
                words, the website would be extremely confusing and ineffective. Although there aren’t any icons within this website, it is still a successful interface, because it is to the point and intuitive to the users.

            <h3>1 | January 12, 2017</h3>

            <p>A user interface I use everyday is Facebook, because it allows me to connect with my family and friends from all steps of life. The ability to connect with people from around the world and the different amount of content continuously encourages
                users to scroll through their newsfeed. Due to the large amount of active users on the site, everyone’s newsfeed is updated with new content. In an aesthetic aspect, the interface of Facebook is busy, because the page has a lot of text.
                However, with this amount of text, Facebook successfully minimizes the appearance by giving the webpage columns and creating a system for visual hierarchy. This interface also encourages user interaction, because they include buttons such
                as “like,” “comment,” and “share” to encourage users to show how they feel about a certain article or image. Facebook also allows users to follow and like pages from their favorite companies, celebrities, and internet personalities, which
                invites even more engagement from the user.</p>
