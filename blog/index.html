                <p>A user interface I use everyday is Facebook, because it allows me to connect with my family and friends from all steps of life. The ability to connect with people from around the world and the different amount of content continuously encourages users to scroll through their newsfeed. Due to the large amount of active users on the site, everyone’s newsfeed is updated with new content. In an aesthetic aspect, the interface of Facebook is busy, because the page has a lot of text. However, with this amount of text, Facebook successfully minimizes the appearance by giving the webpage columns and creating a system for visual hierarchy. This interface also encourages user interaction, because they include buttons such as “like,” “comment,” and “share” to encourage users to show how they feel about a certain article or image. Facebook also allows users to follow and like pages from their favorite companies, celebrities, and internet personalities, which invites even more engagement from the user.</p>
