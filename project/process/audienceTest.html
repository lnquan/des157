        <h3>Audience Testing</h3>
        <p>Hello!</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in this user testing. Venture is a mobile app that is meant to provide people with companions when they are feeling unsafe or uncomfortable being alone. Please follow these steps for me to learn how to improve the app.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type in a place to go and press go.</li>
<li>You are traveling by Uber and moving at a fast speed, so nearby companions aren’t necessary. Please select the best fit for a companion.</li>
<li>Select your companions.</li>
<li>You’ve arrived at your location. Please choose the option that best fits.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another scenario after you’ve finished the first:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You’re walking around at night and you feel someone is behind you.</li>
<li>You want your friends to know where you are. Please click on the appropriate button. </li>
<li>The person behind you continues to follow you. You think it best to contact the authorities. Please press on the button to do so.</li>
<li>You can’t really call them or else the person behind you is listening, please click on the appropriate answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you!</p>
