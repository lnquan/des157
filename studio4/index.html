            <h2>Roman Holiday</h2>
            <div id="sect1p">
                <p>Valentine's Day originated from an old Roman Festival known as Lupercalia, celebrated on February 15. In order to “Christianize” the pagan celebration, placed the St. Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February to commemorate the death
                    or burial of St. Valentine in around 270 A.D. Lupercalia became outlawed in the 5th century and Pope Gelasius declared February 14 as St. Valentine’s Day.

            <div id="sect3p">
                <p>Around the 18th century, exchanging love notes on Valentine’s Day became extremely popular. It was first hand made, but as popularity grew, it became commercialized. The tradition spread to America and Esther A. Howland thought it was
